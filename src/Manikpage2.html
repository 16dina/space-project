                            <p class="content">Movies rarely get sound right in space. I guess that if you’re spending a fortune on filming
                                an explosion or a dramatic death, you definitely want the audience to hear it. However, space means no
                                atmosphere which means there is nothing for the sound waves to travel though. Again, Kubrick got this one
                                right in 2001. However, this shouldn’t suggest that there is no sound in the universe apart from our planet.
                                If you go someplace else with an atmosphere, then there will be sound, but it will probably be a little
                                weird. On Mars, for example, sound will be higher in pitch.</p>

                            <p class="content">Ask anyone to draw a Sun and they will immediately reach for the yellow crayon. It seems
                                normal. We’ve been using that yellow crayon for the Sun ever since we were little and all we could draw was
                                the crappy front of a house and the Sun smiling in the corner (come on, that definitely wasn’t just me,
                                right?). If we ever needed more evidence, we could just go outside and look at the sun and it definitely
                                appears to be yellow.

                                Thing is, though, that we see it yellow thanks to our atmosphere. If you’re sure that you’ve seen NASA
                                photographs or similar images and the Sun was yellow there, too, you might actually be right. This image we
                                have of a yellow Sun is so prevalent that sometimes astronomers will actually modify the color of their
                                pictures in order to make them more recognizable. However, the real color of the Sun is white. If you ever
                                meet as astronaut or someone who has been to space, feel free to ask them.

                                Regardless, we don’t need to see the Sun to know what color it is because we can tell from the temperature.
                                Cool stars start off with a brown/dark red color and increase in intensity as they get hotter. Something
                                with only a few thousand degrees Kelvin surface temperature will be red. At the opposite end of the
                                spectrum, the hottest stars with a surface temp above 10000 Kelvin are blue. With a surface temperature of
                                almost 6000 Kelvin, the Sun is somewhere in the middle, giving it a distinct white color.</p>

                                Immediately, some people said there must have been aliens on the Red Planet that left that face behind as
                                evidence of their existence. NASA, however, pointed out that the suspected face is really just a pile of
                                rocks casting shadows that resemble face-like features.

                                NASA followed up with better-resolution pictures taken from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars
                                Global Surveyor in 1998 and 2001, respectively. These new images made it quite clear that the "face on Mars"
                                is nothing more than a trick of light and shadows on a completely normal Martian mound.

                                Venus (the second planet from the Sun) is the hottest planet in the solar system, but that's because of its
                                atmosphere, which contains mostly carbon dioxide and some nitrogen, making it very thick. Throughout the
                                year the surface of Venus remains at a temperature of about 462°C. The surface of Mercury, on the other
                                hand, has a lot of temperature variations. It can be as cold as -173°C at night, and during the day it might
                                reach 427°C. Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, which is why there's so much variation in temperature.

                                the lungs and the water in body tissue, but human skin is actually tight enough to prevent exploding. A
                                person exposed to space would eventually die when circulation stops, after dissolved gases in the blood form
                                bubbles and block flow. Basically, it's like an extreme version of "the bends" that divers can get.

                                Sun staying put in the Milky Way. What astronauts actually experience in space is what NASA calls
                                micro-gravity. It has nothing to do with the actual strength of gravity, which is only very slightly less on
                                the International Space Station. It's because astronauts are constantly falling, so they seem weightless.

                                quickly into its deadly maw. We would eventually freeze to death, but that’s not the great (but unfounded)
                                fear with black holes.

                                Black holes must obey other laws of physics, and the gravitational power of the sun would be the same if it
                                were somehow turned into black hole. Black holes have finite mass and, therefore, finite gravitational
                                force. No one knows for sure what happens to items pulled into black holes, but we do know black holes do
                                not possess super gravity.

                                that produces an atmospheric pressure so low that water boils at the normal temperature of the human body:
                                37 °C (98.6 °F). The Armstrong line begins at an altitude of approximately 18 km (60,000 ft) to about 19 km
                                (62,000 ft). It would be better to wear a spacesuit above that altitude, for your own safety (your blood’s

                                At or above the Armstrong limit, exposed bodily liquids such as saliva, tears, urine, blood, and the liquids

                                any means will sustain life for more than a few minutes.

                            <p class="content">Technically, it’s not called jetpack. It’s called the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU). It is an
                                astronaut propulsion unit that was used by NASA on three Space Shuttle missions in 1984. In the first one of
                                these missions, NASA astronaut Bruce McCandless II (June 8, 1937 – December 21, 2017) made the first ever
                                untethered free flight using the MMU and with a distance of 98 meters (320 feet) from the space shuttle, he
                                also broke the spacewalking record.

                                The MMU allowed the astronauts to perform untethered EVA spacewalks at a distance from the shuttle. The MMU
                                was used in practice to retrieve a pair of faulty communications satellites, Westar VI and Palapa B2.
                                Following the third mission, the unit was retired from use. A smaller successor, the Simplified Aid For EVA
                                Rescue (SAFER), was first flown in 1994 and is intended for emergency use only. So no, astronauts do not fly
                                around using jetpacks, MMUs, or whatever else.

                            <p class="content">This is simply not true.
                                In fact, most of the time comets are very difficult things to find. Comets tend to spend large amounts of
                                time in the darkness of space.
                                Here, far from the influence of stars, they remain frozen and relatively inactive. They only develop tails
                                when they approach a star, like our Sun. At this point, they warm up and develop a cloudy atmosphere (called
                                a Coma) as well as their distinctive tails. These tails, as you'd expect, always point away from any star
                                whose influence they are under.
                                These tails are effectively blown away from the comet by solar winds and solar radiation. In fact, the
                                'tail' can actually be ahead of the comet as it flies away from the Sun!
